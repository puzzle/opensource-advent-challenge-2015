# Thömus Open Source Advent Challenge 2015

This is the GitHub Page based on the following Template 

* [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/)

## Building the css

* To edit CSS you can edit the less files.
* Install less globally with `npm install -g less` or locally with `npm install less´ (if you install locally you need to set a path, see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9069104/lessc-binary-not-available-after-installing-less-via-npm)
